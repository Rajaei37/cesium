# Website Design Comparison Report: Odin Recharge Bot vs. Cesium Marketing Design

## 1. Overview Summary

This report details the discrepancies between the live website at `https://odin-recharge-bot.online/` and the provided `Cesium Marketing – Final Website Design Handoff` document. Overall, the live website appears to be an early implementation that deviates significantly from the final design specifications. Many sections are either missing, incomplete, or do not adhere to the specified visual and interactive guidelines. The current site lacks the refined typography, color palette, interactive elements, and animations described in the design document.




## 2. Section-by-Section Analysis

### Homepage - Header

**URL / Component Name:** Header (top of page)

**Design Stated In PDF:**
*   Logo (top left)
*   Navigation: Home, Services, Our Process, News, Contact, Careers
*   Call-to-action button: Start Now.

**Current Implementation:**
*   **Logo:** Present, but the text "Cesium" is displayed next to it, which is not explicitly mentioned in the design document.
*   **Navigation:**
    *   `Home`, `Services`, `Our process`, `News`, `Contact` are present.
    *   `Careers` is present as `Join our Team`.
    *   The navigation items are displayed horizontally, but their styling (font, size, spacing) does not match the design guidelines.
*   **Call-to-action button:** `Schedule Time` and `Request Call` buttons are present, but the design specifies a single `Start Now` button. The current buttons are floating on the right side of the screen, not integrated into the header navigation as implied by the design.
